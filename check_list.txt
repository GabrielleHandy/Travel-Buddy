Questions to Ask Yourself While Researching
Think about features…

What are you thinking about for your MVP?

For MVP: 
--I want to be able to find embassy information, up to date corona info and weather info for destinations.
--I also want a way to save that info in a "Travel Planner" 
--a google translate option

What might you include in your 2.0 phase?
--budget calculator
--Create a checklist before traveling 
--money conversion calculator
--ability to customize(within reason) travel planner

Any “stretch” ideas you might include in 3.0 and beyond?
--A way to add your own links and videos of places you want to go. **Think vision board**
--Add flight info (add price to budget, add to calendar)
-- mobile app conversion
--I want youtube recommeneded videos
--Groupchat think like facebook groups 


If you’re planning to use an API…

Read the docs throughly

Request an API key (if necessary)
--OCR API Need an Access Key?: YES  Got the Key?: YES
--MyMemory - Translation Memory Need an Access Key?: YES  Got the Key?: YES
--https://openweathermap.org/api API Need an Access Key?: YES   Got the Key?: YES
--Using a database https://github.com/database-of-embassies/database-of-embassies.git ?? Want to just use a smaller more deatiled datbase for US and Canada for now.
--Destination Safety, Health & Covid Alerts API  Need an Access Key?:   Got the Key?:

Research Python wrappers and try out any you find
--Python Wrappers are bascially functions that wrap your written functions to change them when called but not permanantly
--One wrapper I'm looking into is @register: this wrapper/decorator makes a funstion only called at termination

See if there’s a console online you can use to explore what data you’ll get back

Play around with the API in the terminal (using curl) or in Python (using requests or a Python wrapper)

If you’re planning to use a static dataset…

Be clear what data is included

Look at some of the actual data to get a sense of how clean/consistently-formatted it is

If you’re planning to use a Python library…

Try to get it installed in your development environment

Read the docs and play around with it to get a sense of how easy or hard it is to use
